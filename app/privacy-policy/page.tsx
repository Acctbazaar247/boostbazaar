      <p className="mb-4">
        This policy covers how we use your personal information. We take your privacy seriously and will take all measures to protect your personal information.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Any personal information received will only be used to fill your order. We will not sell or redistribute your personal information to anyone. All personal information is encrypted and saved in secure servers.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Return Policy</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        No refunds will be made to your payment method. After a deposit has been completed, there is no way to reverse it. You must use your balance on orders from AcctPanel.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        You agree that once you complete a payment, you will not file a dispute or a chargeback against us for any reason.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        If you file a dispute or chargeback against us after a deposit, we reserve the right to terminate all future orders and ban you from our site. We also reserve the right to take away any followers or likes we delivered to you or your clients' Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, or other social media account.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Orders placed on AcctPanel will not be refunded or canceled after they are placed. You will receive a refund credit to your AcctPanel account if the order is non-deliverable.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Misplaced or private account orders will not qualify for a refund. Be sure to confirm each and every order before placing it.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Fraudulent activity, such as using unauthorized or stolen credit cards, will lead to the termination of your account. There are no exceptions.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Please do not use more than one server at the same time for the same page. We cannot give you the correct followers/likes number in that case, and we will not refund these orders.
